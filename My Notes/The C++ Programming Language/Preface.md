# Preface

- C++ feels like a new language. That is, I can express my ideas more clearly, more simply, and more directly in C++11 than I could in C++98. Furthermore, the resulting programs are better checked by the compiler and run faster.

- In this book, I aim for completeness. I describe every language feature and standard-library component that a professional programmer is likely to need. For each, I provide:
- *Rationale*: What kinds of problems is it designed to help solve? What principles underlie the design? What are the fundamental limitations?
- *Specification*: What is its definition? The level of detail is chosen for the expert programmer; the aspiring language lawyer can follow the many references to the ISO standard.
- Examples: How can it be used well by itself and in combination with other features? What are the key techniques and idioms? What are the implications for maintainability and performance?

- The use of C++ has changed dramatically over the years and so has the language itself. From the point of view of a programmer, most of the changes have been improvements. The current ISO standard C++ is simply a far better tool for writing quality software than were previous versions.

- C++ is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing the design and use of type-rich, lightweight abstractions. It is particularly suited for resource-constrained applications, such as those found in software infrastructures. C++ rewards the programmer who takes the time to master techniques for writing quality code. C++ is a language for someone who takes the task of programming seriously. Our civilization depends critically on software; it had better be quality software.

- A professional software developer masters more than just one programming language.

- A computer is a universal machine, and C++ serves it in that capacity. In particular, C++’s design aims to be sufficiently flexible and general to cope with future problems undreamed of by its designers.

# Preface to the Third Edition

- C++’s support for design and programming has improved dramatically over the years, and lots of new helpful techniques have been developed for its use.
- Ordinary practical programmers have achieved significant improvements in productivity, maintainability, flexibility, and quality in projects of just about any kind and scale.
- Only a good understanding of the ideas behind the language facilities leads to mastery.

# Preface to the Second Edition

- C++ has been evolving to meet the needs of its users. This evolution has been guided by the experience of users of widely varying backgrounds working in a great range of application areas.
- The primary aim of the language extensions made in the last six years has been to enhance C++ as a language for data abstraction and object-oriented programming in general and to enhance it as a tool for writing high-quality libraries of user-defined types in particular.
- C++ is a general-purpose programming language; its core application domain is systems programming in the broadest sense.
- Implementations of C++ exist from some of the most modest microcomputers to the largest supercomputers and for almost all operating systems.

# Preface to the First Edition

- C++ is a general purpose programming language designed to make programming more enjoyable for the serious programmer.
- C++ and its standard libraries are designed for portability. The current implementation will run on most systems that support C. C libraries can be used from a C++ program, and most tools that support programming in C can be used with C++.
