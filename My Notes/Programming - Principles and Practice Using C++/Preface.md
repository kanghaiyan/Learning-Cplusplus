# Preface

- Programming is the art of expressing solutions to problems so that a computer can execute those solutions. Much of the effort in programming is spent finding and refining solutions. Often, a problem is only fully understood through the process of programming a solution for it.

- Why would you want to program? Our civilization runs on software. Without understanding software, you are reduced to believing in “magic” and will be locked out of many of the most interesting, profitable, and socially useful technical fields of work.

- Like mathematics, programming – when done well – is a valuable intellectual exercise that sharpens our ability to think. However, thanks to feedback from the computer, programming is more concrete than most forms of math and therefore accessible to more people. It is a way to reach out and change the world – ideally for the better. Finally, programming can be great fun.

- This book aims to serve those who want to write nontrivial programs for the use of others and to do so responsibly, providing a decent level of system quality. That is, I assume that you want to achieve a level of professionalism. I won’t waste your time with material of marginal practical importance. If an idea is explained here, it’s because you’ll almost certainly need it.
