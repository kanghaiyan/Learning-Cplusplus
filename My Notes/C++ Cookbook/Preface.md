# Preface

- This is a book about solving common problems with C++, but not a book about learning C++. We assume that you have at least a basic knowledge of C++ and object-oriented programming.

- C++ has little or no standardized support for multithreading or XML parsing. Thus, we used the multi-threading support provided in the Boost Threads library and the XML parsing functionality provided by the Xerces parser.
