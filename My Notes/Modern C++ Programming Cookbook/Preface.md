# Preface

- This book is organized into recipes, each covering one particular language or library feature, or a common problem that developers often face and the typical solution to it using modern C++. Through more than 150 recipes, you will learn to master both core language features and the standard libraries; including those for strings, containers, algorithms, iterators, streams, regular expressions, threads, filesystem, atomic operations, utilities, and ranges.
