# Preface

- C++ feels like a new language. That is, I can express my ideas more clearly, more simply, and more directly today than I could in C++98 or C++11. Furthermore, the resulting programs are better checked by the compiler and run faster.
- Like other modern languages, C++ is large and there are a large number of libraries needed for effective use.
- This thin book aims to give an experienced programmer an idea of what constitutes modern C++. It covers most major language features and the major standard-library components. This book can be read in just a day or two but, obviously, there is much more to writing good C++ than can be learned in that amount of time. However, the aim here is not mastery, but to give an overview, to give key examples, and to help a programmer get started.

- There is far more to the C++ ecosystem than just the facilities offered by ISO standard (e.g., libraries, build systems, analysis tools, and development environments). There is an enormous amount of material (of varying quality) available on the Web.
