## Changes

- ***New Random Number Generator*** - Modern C++ provides a new and improved random number generator with an intuitive syntax for getting a random number within a specified range.

- ***Tuples*** - Chapter 17, which covers the Standard Template Library, provides a new section on the tuple library. Tuples are explained and numerous examples of using tuples to store and retrieve data are given.

- ***New Forms of String and Numeric Literals*** - This edition introduces raw string literals, binary literals, and the use of digit separators in numeric literals.

- **The *filesystem* Library** - Chapter 12 includes a new section on the filesystem library, which was introduced in C++ 17. The filesystem library allows you to work with files and directories at the operating system level, performing operations such as copying and deleting files, getting a list of a directory’s contents, and recursively traversing a directory tree.

- ***Structured Binding Declarations*** - Structured binding declarations, which were introduced in C++ 17, provide a concise syntax for unpacking a collection or data structure and assigning its contents to individual variables. This edition shows how to use structured binding declarations to unpack arrays, structures, and tuples.

- ***Defaulted and Deleted Operations*** - Chapter 14 shows how to use the default and delete key words to explicitly instruct the compiler to either generate or not generate a class’s default constructor, default copy constructor, default move constructor, default copy assignment operator, and default destructor.

- ***Usage of typename Instead of class In Templates*** - In the code for function and class templates, this edition uses the typename key word instead of the class key word for declaring type parameters.

- **The *noexcept* Key Word** - Chapter 16 in this edition introduces the noexcept key word and discusses its use for declaring functions that do not throw an exception.

- ***Enhanced Discussion of Deleting Nodes in a Linked List*** - Chapter 18’s explanation of deleting a node in a linked list has been expanded with more detail, including a new figure that illustrates the process of unlinking a node, and pseudo-code describing the process for deleting a node in either a sorted or an unsorted linked list.

- ***Variadic Function Templates*** - Chapter 20 presents a new section on variadic function templates, which allow you to write a set of function templates that use recursion to process a variable number of arguments.
