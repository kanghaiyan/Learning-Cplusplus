# 1. Welcome

- The book focuses on newer developers who inherit existing C++ projects. Understanding why specific mistakes exist helps you know how to detect and avoid writing similar issues. The mistakes start with class design and end with a few modern C++ techniques. Learning these new features should encourage you to improve your inherited code and leave it in a much better state for the next developer.

- ***By the end of this book, you should have a solid understanding of the following:***
	- Several mistakes that have found their way into existing C++ code and their solutions
	- Detecting these and similar problems to prevent writing new mistakes
	- Why these issues are mistakes and how to think more correctly about using C++

- The mistakes are written from the viewpoint of a teacher mentoring newer developers. I write with the hope that you will better understand our failings with C++ over the years and significantly improve our efforts as the language matures.
