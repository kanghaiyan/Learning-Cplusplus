# Introduction

- C++ is powerful. Very powerful. Arguably, more powerful even than most programming languages. So, yes, like with any powerful tool, you can wield some considerable damage if you use it without proper training. We often compare C++ to a Swiss Army knife: age-old, trusted, incredibly versatile, yet potentially mind-boggling and full of pointy things that could really hurt you. But once someone tells you what all those pointy things are for and teaches you some elementary knife safety rules, you’ll never have to look for another pocket knife again.
- C++ does not need to be dangerous or difficult at all. C++ today is much more accessible than many assume. The language has come a long way since its conception nearly 40 years ago. We’ve learned how to wield all its mighty blades and tools in the safest and most effective way possible. And more importantly, the C++ language and its Standard Library have evolved accordingly to facilitate this. The past decade has seen the rise of what is now known as modern C++. Modern C++ emphasizes the use of newer, more expressive, and safer language features combined with tried and tested best practices and coding guidelines. Once you know and apply a handful of simple rules and techniques, C++ loses much of its complexity. The key is that someone properly and gradually explains not simply what you can do with C++ but rather what you should do with C++. And that’s where this book comes in!
