# Preface

- "When you're working in C++, you have to think carefully about what you're doing. C++ is a powerful language designed to help solve demanding problems, and it's important that you hone your knowledge of the language, its library, and its programming idioms as finely as you can."

- This book isn't a random grab-bag of code puzzles; it's primarily a guide to sound real-world enterprise software design in C++. It uses a problem/solution format because that's the most effective way I know to involve you, gentle reader, in the ideas behind the problems and the reasons behind the guidelines. Although the Items cover a variety of topics, you'll notice recurring themes that focus on enterprise development issues, particularly exception safety, sound class and module design, appropriate optimization, and writing portable standards-conforming code.
