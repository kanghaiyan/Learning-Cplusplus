- The C++ programming language is undergoing continuous development and improvement. This effort to keep C++ on the cutting edge of language features is driven by the fact that C++ still finds an important role to play in high-performance, portable applications. Few other languages can be used on as many platforms as C++ and without having a runtime environment dependency. This is partly thanks to the nature of C++ as a compiled programming language. C++ programs are built into application binaries through a combination of processes that include compiling and linking.
