# Preface

- In 2011, the C++ standards committee issued a major revision to the ISO C++ standard. This revised standard is latest step in C++â€™s evolution and continues the emphasis on programmer efficiency. The primary goals of the new standard are to
	- ***Make the language more uniform and easier to teach and to learn***
	- ***Make the standard libraries easier, safer, and more efficient to use***
	- ***Make it easier to write efficient abstractions and libraries***
