# Preface

-  Some of the things that give object-oriented developers headaches can be easily handled by looking at the problem in a new way - the functional way.

- Because most of my work revolves around C++, I had to find a way to use functional programming idioms with it. It turned out Iâ€™m not the only one; the world is filled with people who have similar ideas. I had the good fortune to meet some of them at various C++ conferences. This was the perfect opportunity to exchange ideas, learn new things, and share experiences about applying functional idioms in C++.
