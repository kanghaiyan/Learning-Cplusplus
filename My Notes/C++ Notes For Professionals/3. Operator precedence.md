# 3. Operator precedence

## Logical && and || operators: short-circuit

- && has precedence over ||, this means that parentheses are placed to evaluate what would be evaluated together.

- c++ uses short-circuit evaluation in && and || to not do unnecessary executions. If the left hand side of || returns true the right hand side does not need to be evaluated anymore.
## Unary Operators

- Unary operators act on the object upon which they are called and have high precedence.
- When used postfix, the action occurs only after the entire operation is evaluated, leading to some interesting arithmetics.

## Arithmetic operators

- Arithmetic operators in C++ have the same precedence as they do in mathematics:
	- Multiplication and division have left associativity(meaning that they will be evaluated from left to right) and they have higher precedence than addition and subtraction, which also have left associativity.
	- We can also force the precedence of expression using parentheses ( ). Just the same way as you would do that in normal mathematics.

## Logical AND and OR operators

- These operators have the usual precedence in C++: AND before OR.
