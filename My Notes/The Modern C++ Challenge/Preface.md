# Preface

- C++ is designed for efficiency and is the primary choice in applications where performance is key.

- With the standard covering almost 1500 pages, C++ is not the simplest language to learn and master. Skills are not acquired only by reading about them or watching others exercising them, but by practicing them again and again.

- This book is a collection of 100 real-world problems designed for you to practice a large variety of the C++ language and standard library features as well as many third-party, cross-platform libraries.

- The problems in this book are grouped into 12 chapters. Each chapter contains problems on similar or related topics. The problems have different levels of difficulty; some of them are easy, some are moderate, and some are difficult. The book has a relatively equal number of problems for each difficulty level.

- Each chapter starts with the description of the proposed problems. The solutions to these problems ensue with recommendations, explanations, and source code.

-  There is only one thing that is missing in the source code presented in the book - the headers you have to include. This was left out on purpose so that you figure those out by yourself. On the other hand, the source code provided with the book is complete, and you can find all the required headers there.

- Many other libraries are used for solving problems in the book. The list includes Asio, Crypto++, Curl, NLohmann/json, PDF-Writer, PNGWriter, pugixml, SQLite, and ZipLib. Also, as an alternative to the *std::optional* and the *filesystem* libraries used throughout the book, you can use Boost with compilers where these are not available. All these libraries are open source and cross-platform. They were chosen for reasons that include performance, good documentation, and wide use within the community. However, you are free to use any other libraries you would like to solve the problems.
