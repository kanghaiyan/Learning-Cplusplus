# 2. Exception Safety Issues and Techniques

- Exception handling is a fundamental error reporting mechanism in modern languages.
- In this section we turn our attention to some specific exception-related language features. We begin by answering some perennial questions: Is exception safety all about writing Try and catch in the right places? If not, then what? And what kinds of things should you consider when developing an exception safety policy for your software?

- Delving beyond that, it's worth spending an entire Item to lay out reasons why writing exception-safe code is good for you, because doing that promotes programming styles that lead to more robust and more maintainable code in general, quite apart from their benefits in the presence of exceptions. 
- But there is a limit to goodness and to "if some is good, then more is better" thinking, and that limit is hit well and hard when we get to exception specifications: Why are they in the language? Why are they well motivated in principle? And why, despite all that, should you stop using them in your programs?
