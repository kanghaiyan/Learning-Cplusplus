# 7. Style Case Studies

- It might be cheeky to dissect published code. It might be cheeky, but it's fun.
 
 - This concluding section introduces a new theme: We will examine several pieces of real-world published code, critique it to illustrate proper design and coding style by demonstrating what the published code does well and does poorly, and use that information to develop an improved version. You might be amazed at just how much can be done even with code that has been written, vetted, and proofread by experts.

- Enjoy! But, in the spirit of straws and rafters, keep also in the back of your mind how some of these same issues might just apply also to the code checked into your own source-control system.
