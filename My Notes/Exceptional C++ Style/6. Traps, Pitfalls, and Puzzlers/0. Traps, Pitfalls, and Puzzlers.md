# 6. Traps, Pitfalls, and Puzzlers

- Why does C++, like most programming languages, reserve the names of keywords, so that, for example, you can't have a variable named class? Why does a line of code that looks like it ought to be doing some real work actually turn out to do nothing at all, with the compiler emitting not even a single machine instruction for it as though the line didn't even exist? On the other hand, why does code that looks just down-right wrong actually compile and run just fine, legally and reliably? When you're floating in a sea of numbers, why is it good to double-check your work?
