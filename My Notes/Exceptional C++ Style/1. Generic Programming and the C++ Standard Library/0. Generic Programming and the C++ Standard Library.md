# 1. Generic Programming and the C++ Standard Library

- One of C++'s most powerful features is its support for generic programming. This power is reflected directly in the flexibility of the C++ standard library, especially in its containers, iterators, and algorithms.
- This book opens with Items that focus our attention on some familiar parts of the STL, notably vector and string, as well as on some that might be less familiar. How can you avoid common gotchas when using the standard library's most basic container, vector ? How would you perform common C-style string manipulation in C++? What lessons, good and bad and down-right ugly, can we learn about library design from the STL itself?

- After getting our feet wet, we'll dive into more general issues with templates and generic programming in C++. How can we avoid making our own templated code need-lessly (and quite unintentionally) nongeneric? Why is it actually a bad idea to specialize function templates, and what should we do instead? How can we correctly and portably do something as seemingly simple as grant friendship in the world of templates? And what's with this funny little export keyword, anyway?
