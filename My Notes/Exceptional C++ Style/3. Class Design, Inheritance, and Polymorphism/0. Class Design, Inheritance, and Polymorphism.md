# 3. Class Design, Inheritance, and Polymorphism

- In addition to the generic paradigm, C++ equally supports object-oriented design and programming. This section turns the spotlight on this more traditional area, with particular attention to the way C++ exposes OO features. To get started, we'll consider a real-world example of code containing a subtle flaw, and we'll use it as a springboard to review basic object construction and tear-down ordering. Then it's on to an in-depth foray into the world of writing robust code, which touches on the issue of code security: First, what parts of a class are accessible from various other code and, in particular, what ways are there for "leaking" the private parts of a class, intentionally or otherwise? What is encapsulation, and how does it relate to the choices we can and should make about member accessibility? Finally, how can we make our classes safer for versioning and for ensuring that base class contracts are easy to maintain correctly and won't be subverted accidentally?or otherwise in derived classes, which would otherwise lead to broken contracts and even security holes?
