# Foreword by Shawn Edwards

- C++ language, in its mission to deliver zero overhead and maximum performance, necessarily provides few guardrails; syntax and type safety go only so far.
- Using C++ features in unsound ways and creating spectacular failures was always easy. But because the language was relatively stable, good developers — over time — learned how to write reliable C++ software.

- Modern C++ has much to offer — both good and bad. Many of its newer features offer the prospect of improving performance, expressiveness, maintainability, and so on. On the other hand, many of these same features come with potential pitfalls, some of which are obvious, and others less so. With each new release of C++, now every three years, the language gets bigger, and the opportunities for misusing a feature, through lack of knowledge and experience, grow ever larger as well.

- Using new features of an already sophisticated programming language such as C++, with which many developers might not be fully familiar, introduces its own category of risk. Less-seasoned engineers might unwittingly introduce new features into a mature code base where they could add manifestly negative value in that context. As ever, only time and experience can provide proof as to whether and under what conditions using a new C++ language feature would be prudent. We, as senior developers, team leads, and technical managers of a leading financial technology company, bear responsibility for protecting our Software Capital asset from undue risk.

- We cannot justify the instability of rewriting all of our software every time a new version of the language appears, nor can we leave it in perpetual stasis and forgo the important benefits modern C++ has to offer. So we move forward but with expertise and caution, adopting features only after we fully understand them.

- If you’ve been writing programs in C++ for more than a decade, you’ve undoubtedly noticed that being an accomplished C++ programmer is a different challenge than it used to be. This book will help you navigate the modern C++ landscape so that you too can feel confident in applying C++11/14 in ways that truly add value without undue risk to your organization’s precious Software Capital investment.
