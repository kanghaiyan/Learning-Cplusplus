# Part I: Fundamentals

- Attempting to use any tool before understanding at least the basics of what it does and how it is meant to be used is most likely going to result in frustration. On the other hand, spending all one’s time learning the theory about something without getting hands-on makes for a rather boring experience and often leads to an overly idealistic understanding. This first part of the book follows a logical progression through CMake’s more fundamental features and concepts and is structured to enable the reader to immediately experiment and to do increasingly useful things with each chapter. The goal is to incrementally build up the base knowledge needed to use CMake effectively, with an emphasis on being able to put that knowledge into practice right away.

- The initial focus in the first few chapters is on building a basic executable or library, covering just enough to give a new developer a quick introduction to CMake. Subsequent chapters expand that knowledge to demonstrate how to get the most out of what CMake has to offer. The techniques presented are aimed at real world use, with the intention of establishing good habits and teaching sound methods which scale to very large projects and can handle more complex scenarios.
