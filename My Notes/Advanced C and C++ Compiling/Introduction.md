# Introduction

- The information about a vast variety of programming languages is readily available, through thousands of books, magazines, articles, web forums, and blogs, ranging from the absolute beginner level all the way to the “prepare for the Google programming interview” tips.
- These kinds of topics, however, cover only about half of the skills required by the software professional. Soon after the immediate gratifcation of seeing the program we created actually executing (and doing it right) comes the next level of important questions: how to architect the code to allow for easy further modifcations, how to extract reusable parts of the functionality for future use, how to allow smooth adjustment for diferent environments (starting from diferent human languages and alphabets, all the way to running on diferent operating systems).
